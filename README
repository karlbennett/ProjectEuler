These are my solutions to the problems on the Project Euler website (http://projecteuler.net).
They can be run in three different ways, but befoe trying to run then you must make sure you have sbcls (Steel Bank Common Lisp) installed.

First: If running under Unix just run the related executable shell scripts e.g. euler-001.sh.

Second: Again if under Unix place the .sbclrc file into your $HOME directory then uncomment the shebang line in each of the *.lisp files and chmod them to be executable.
	1:	~/ProjectEuler/> cp .sbclrc ~/
	2:	~/ProjectEuler/> vim *.lisp 
		Change -	;#!/usr/bin/sbcl --noinform
		To -		#!/usr/bin/sbcl --noinform
	3:	> chmod +x *.lisp
	4:	> ./euler-001.lisp

Third: Run the *.lisp files with the following command.
	~/ProjectEuler/> sbcl --noinform --noprint --load <lisp filename>
